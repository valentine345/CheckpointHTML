        Kevin Darnell Hart[2] was born in Philadelphia on July 6, 1979,[3] the son of Nancy (died 2007)[4] and Henry Hart.[3][5] He has an older brother named Robert.[2] He was raised in a single-parent household by his mother, who worked as a systems analyst for the Office of Student Registration and Financial Services at the University of Pennsylvania.[2] His father was a cocaine addict who was in and out of jail throughout most of Hart's childhood, prompting Hart to use humor as a way to cope with his troubled family life.[3] His relationship with his father improved after his father recovered from his addiction.[4] He would also later talk about his mother in his stand-up routine, portraying her as a loving yet intimidating woman.[6]
